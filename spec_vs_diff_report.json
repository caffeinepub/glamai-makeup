  "summary": "The diff fully implements REQ-8. A Zustand-based `useSearch` hook shares search state globally between the Header and ProductGrid. The Header has a centered search input with a clear button near the hamburger menu, styled to match the existing dark/light mode theme and responsive on mobile/desktop. ProductGrid filters the three hardcoded products case-insensitively and shows a 'No products found' message with an icon when no matches exist. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
